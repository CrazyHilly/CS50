Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations the order of winners was upside down almost for each pair.
Some teams did not even get to the winners table.
Also, chances for winning of a particular team could differ up to 5 points from the results with bigger number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations.
